DESCRIPTION

This assignment is about making the Graph ADT and using it
to perform the DFS algorithm. After performing the BFS,
information about the strongly connected components will
be known.

--------------
FILES

- List.h: This file contains function prototypes of the List ADT.
- List.c: This file contains the actual functions of the List ADT.
- Graph.h: This file contains function prototypes of the Graph ADT.
- Graph.c: This file contains the actual functions of the List ADT.
- GraphTest.c: This file contains test cases for the Graph ADT.
- FindComponents.c: This file performs DFS algorithms to find
                    the strongly connected components of a Graph.
  and a few other things like keeping track of distances and parents.
- Makefile: This file creates the main two programs Lex and ListTest.
- README: This file contains information about the other files.
