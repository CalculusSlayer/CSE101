Matrixes with a lot of zeros are called "sparse". The
different operations required for this project include
copy, transpose, sum, dif, product, and newMatrix.

FILES

- List.h: This file contains function prototypes of the List ADT.
- List.c: This file contains the actual functions of the List ADT.
- ListTest.c: This file contains test cases for the List ADT.
- Matrix.h: This file contains function prototypes of the Matrix ADT.
- Matrix.c: This file contains the actual functions of the Matrix ADT.
- MatrixTest.c: This file contains the test cases for the Matrix ADT.
- Sparse.c: This file contains code for the main program. It will perform
            various matrix operations on different matricies.
- Makefile: This file creates the main three programs Sparse, MatrixTest, and ListTest.
- README: This file contains information about the other files.
